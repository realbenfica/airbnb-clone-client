# Airbnb-clone (client)

This is the frontend for my individual Airbnb clone built with React and Redux. In this app you can find a home to stay in, in any given city. As a user you can also add cities and homes to the database. 
It's build using the standard `create-react-app` so the usual `npm start` can be used.

The backend (server) of this project must be running for the app to function correctly. You can find this repository here:
http://github.com/realbenfica/airbnb-clone-server

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
