# Bed and Breakfast (client)

This is the frontend for my individual Airbnb clone built with React and Redux. In this app you can find a home to stay in, in any given city. As a user you can also add cities and homes to the database. 
It's build using the standard `create-react-app` so the usual `npm start` can be used.

The backend (server) of this project must be running for the app to function correctly. You can find this repository here:
